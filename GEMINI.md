## Project Overview

This is a simple command-line password manager written in Python. It allows users to store, search, and delete credentials for various services. The credentials are stored in a JSON file named `credentials.json`.

## Building and Running

To run the password manager, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python passwordManager.py
```

This will start the command-line interface, where you can choose from the following options:

*   Create a new credential
*   Search for a credential
*   Delete a credential
*   Exit the program

## Development Conventions

The project follows standard Python coding conventions. The code is organized into a `PasswordManager` class, which encapsulates all the functionality. The `main` function handles the user interaction and menu-driven interface.
